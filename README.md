# Ants-Vs.-SomeBees
Third project for UC Berkeley's CS61A course

In this project, I created a tower defense game called Ants Vs. SomeBees. As the ant queen, you populate your colony with the bravest ants you can muster. Your ants must protect their queen from the evil bees that invade your territory. Irritate the bees enough by throwing leaves at them, and they will be vanquished. Fail to pester the airborne intruders adequately, and your queen will succumb to the bees' wrath. This game is inspired by PopCap Games' Plants Vs. Zombies.

This project combines functional and object-oriented programming paradigms, focusing on the material from Chapter 2.5 of Composing Programs. The project also involves understanding, extending, and testing a large program.

The ants.zip archive contains several files, but all of my changes were made to ants.py.

My code is contained in sections that begin with: #BEGIN Problem XX
and end with: #END Problem XX

ants.py: The game logic of Ants Vs. SomeBees
ants_gui.py: The original GUI for Ants Vs. SomeBees
gui.py: An new GUI for Ants Vs. SomeBees
graphics.py: Utilities for displaying simple two-dimensional animations
state.py: Abstraction for gamestate for gui.py
utils.py: Some functions to facilitate the game interface
ucb.py: Utility functions for CS 61A
assets: A directory of images and files used by gui.py
img: A directory of images used by ants_gui.py
ok: The autograder
proj3.ok: The ok configuration file
tests: A directory of tests used by ok
mytests.rst: A space for you to add your custom tests; see section on adding your own tests
